The target audience of this README are IoT application developers using the SwiftMoteEC IoT Electrochemical Sensor Platform (referred to as *the mote* subsequently in this document).

# Description of the Demo Application

This application demonstrates the basic functions of the mote acting as a data Server by:
- Reading sensor data from a dummy sensor using the Analog Devices' AD5941 analog front end (AFE)
- Interrupting the BlueNRG-LP microcontroller when sensor data is available
- Sending data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) link to a Client computer
- Receiving and saving the data on the Client

The Server software running on the mote is responsible for interacting with the AD5941 device as well as establishing a connection and communicating with the client application running on a computer. The Server software uses the square-wave voltammetry method to measure data (current) generated on a dummy sensor board connected to the mote and transmits the data to the client via Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The Server application runs on the ST BlueNRG-LP BLE microcontroller on the mote.

The Client software receives the data from the mote over the air, processes it, and then stores it in a file. <br>
Refer to the following two diagrams for detailed communication and control flow of the demo application:

In the demo, the hardware components as shown in the Figure 3 below include:
- A mote
- A debugger used to load the application firmware image into flash memory
- A power supply to provide 3V power to both the BlueNRG-LP and the AD5941 module.
- A dummy sensor consisting of two 500 Ohm resistors in series

## Connections on the mote:

See Figure 4 below:
-	Connect your debugger to the *JTAG/SWD* connector on the mote. In the demo, a Segger J-LINK debugger is used. A J-LINK Mini EDU is also compatible.
-	Connect 3V power to the BlueNRG-LP power pin *B* on the mote
-	Connect 3V power to the AD5941 power pin *P* on the mote
-	Connect the ground of the power supply to the ground pin *G* on the mote
-	Connect the resistors to the *WE*, *CE*, and *RE* metal pads on the mote, respectively, as shown in the picture below.

# Running the Demo Application
Follow the steps below to test the demo application:

a). Supply 3V power to the mote.

b). Program the mote as instructed in the previous section if it has not been done yet.

c). Reset the mote by pressing the reset button.  

d). In Pycharm, select Run | Run main

e). In the Run console of Pycharm, issue one of the following commands:
- 'r' for run once
